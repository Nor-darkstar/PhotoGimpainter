## âš™ How to Install

This patch is originally intended to work with the Flatpak version of GIMP for Linux, but it can be used in almost any package format with no restriction by extracting the files on the correct folders.


### Flatpak (Linux)

In order to install the newest version of PhotoGIMP on your Linux operating system using Flatpak, just follow this simple steps:

1. Make sure you already have GIMP installed [from Flathub](https://flathub.org/apps/org.gimp.GIMP);
2. **Start and quit GIMP after you installed before you continue!**
3. Download the files from this repository [or just click here](https://github.com/Diolinux/PhotoGIMP/releases/download/3.0/PhotoGIMP-linux.zip);
4. Extract the content of the zip file on your home folder (`.config` and `.local` - they are the important ones) and overwrite the files if needed;
5. You're done, enjoy it! :smile:
